 * This is a factory for {@link EidasMetadataParametersI} objects.
 * Now it is simply returning the default implemented object. In the future there there is a possible change in the design:
 * - have two implementations, on in Metadata service, another one in the dependent module(s). The first is similar to
 *   the as-is, it just returns with an object, but in the dependents it could invoke a proxy operation. It depends
 *   on how the Metadata service is designed.
