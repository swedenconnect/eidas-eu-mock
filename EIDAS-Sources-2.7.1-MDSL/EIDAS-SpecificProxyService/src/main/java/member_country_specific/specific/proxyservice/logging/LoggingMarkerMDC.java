/**
 * Utility class used to define the Mapped Diagnostic Contexts and the markers used for logging.
 * Reference : A lighter technique consists of uniquely stamping each log request servicing a given client.
 * Neil Harrison described this method in the book Patterns for Logging Diagnostic Messages in Pattern Languages of Program Design 3,
 * edited by R. Martin, D. Riehle, and F. Buschmann (Addison-Wesley, 1997). Logback leverages a variant of this technique included in the SLF4J API:
 * Mapped Diagnostic Contexts (MDC).
